# What The Hack - Dynatrace & Azure Integration

## Introduction
This hackathon will focus on leveraging Dynatrace's observability capabilities to monitor and troubleshoot native Azure services. Participants will learn how to set up Azure Native Integration with Dynatrace, enable OneAgent observability on Azure VMs, and monitor containerized workloads on AKS using Dynatrace. Additionally, attendees will learn how to automate root cause analysis with Davis and build custom dashboards using Azure Monitor Metrics.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to integrate Dynatrace with Azure services
- Learn how to enable OneAgent observability on Azure VMs
- Gain experience monitoring containerized workloads on AKS with Dynatrace
- Automate root cause analysis with Davis
- Build custom dashboards using Azure Monitor Metrics

## Challenges
- Challenge 00: **Setup Azure Native Integration with Dynatrace** ([Challenge-00.md](Student/Challenge-00.md))
  - Participants will set up Azure Native Integration with Dynatrace, enabling seamless monitoring of Azure services.
- Challenge 01: **OneAgent Observability on Azure VM** ([Challenge-01.md](Student/Challenge-01.md))
  - Participants will learn how to enable OneAgent observability on an Azure VM, allowing Dynatrace to monitor the VM's performance.
- Challenge 02: **Dynatrace Observability on AKS** ([Challenge-02.md](Student/Challenge-02.md))
  - Participants will deploy a containerized workload to AKS and monitor it with Dynatrace.
- Challenge 03: **Automated Root Cause Analysis with Davis** ([Challenge-03.md](Student/Challenge-03.md))
  - Participants will learn how to leverage Dynatrace's AI-powered Davis to automatically troubleshoot performance issues.
- Challenge 04: **Azure Monitor Metrics & Custom Dashboard** ([Challenge-04.md](Student/Challenge-04.md))
  - Participants will create custom dashboards using Azure Monitor Metrics to display relevant performance metrics.
