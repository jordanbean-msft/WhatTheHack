## Notes & Guidance
To complete this challenge, you will need to have an Azure subscription with an application deployed that you can monitor. If you don't have an application, you can create a sample application or use one of the Azure sample applications.

### Step 1: Create a new custom dashboard in Azure Monitor Metrics
1. Navigate to the Azure portal and search for "Azure Monitor" in the search bar.
2. Click on "Azure Monitor" to open the Azure Monitor dashboard.
3. Click on "Metrics" in the left-hand menu.
4. Select the subscription, resource group, and resource that you want to monitor.
5. Click on "+ New dashboard" to create a new custom dashboard.

### Step 2: Add charts and visualizations to the dashboard that display performance metrics for your application
1. Click on "Add chart" to add a new chart to your dashboard.
2. Select the metric that you want to display in your chart, such as CPU usage, memory usage, or network traffic.
3. Choose the aggregation type for the metric, such as average, minimum, maximum, or total.
4. Select the time range for the chart, such as the last hour, day, or week.
5. Choose the chart type that you want to use, such as line chart, area chart, or stacked chart.
6. Repeat these steps to add additional charts and visualizations to your dashboard.

### Step 3: Customize the dashboard to display the data that is most relevant to your use case
1. Click on "Edit" to customize your dashboard.
2. Rearrange the charts and visualizations to display the data in a way that makes sense for your use case.
3. Add annotations or alerts to your dashboard to help you quickly identify issues that may be impacting performance.
4. Customize the time range for the dashboard to display the data that is most relevant to your use case.
5. Save your changes to the dashboard.

### Step 4: Share your dashboard with the other members of your team
1. Click on "Share" to share your dashboard with other members of your team.
2. Choose the access level for each member of your team, such as read-only or read-write access.
3. Share the link to the dashboard with the other members of your team.
