What The Hack - Dynatrace & Azure Integration - Coach Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the coach's guide for the Dynatrace & Azure Integration What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

This hackathon will focus on leveraging Dynatrace's observability capabilities to monitor and troubleshoot native Azure services. Participants will learn how to set up Azure Native Integration with Dynatrace, enable OneAgent observability on Azure VMs, and monitor containerized workloads on AKS using Dynatrace. Additionally, attendees will learn how to automate root cause analysis with Davis and build custom dashboards using Azure Monitor Metrics.

This hack includes an optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to integrate Dynatrace with Azure services
- Learn how to enable OneAgent observability on Azure VMs
- Gain experience monitoring containerized workloads on AKS with Dynatrace
- Automate root cause analysis with Davis
- Build custom dashboards using Azure Monitor Metrics

## Challenges
- Challenge 00: **Setup Azure Native Integration with Dynatrace** ([Challenge-00.md](Student/Challenge-00.md))
  - Participants will set up Azure Native Integration with Dynatrace, enabling seamless monitoring of Azure services.
- Challenge 01: **OneAgent Observability on Azure VM** ([Challenge-01.md](Student/Challenge-01.md))
  - Participants will learn how to enable OneAgent observability on an Azure VM, allowing Dynatrace to monitor the VM's performance.
- Challenge 02: **Dynatrace Observability on AKS** ([Challenge-02.md](Student/Challenge-02.md))
  - Participants will deploy a containerized workload to AKS and monitor it with Dynatrace.
- Challenge 03: **Automated Root Cause Analysis with Davis** ([Challenge-03.md](Student/Challenge-03.md))
  - Participants will learn how to leverage Dynatrace's AI-powered Davis to automatically troubleshoot performance issues.

  - Participants will create custom dashboards using Azure Monitor Metrics to display relevant performance metrics.

## Coach Prerequisites
This hack has pre-reqs that a coach is responsible for understanding and/or setting up BEFORE hosting an event. Please review the [What The Hack Hosting Guide](https://aka.ms/wthhost) for information on how to host a hack event.

The guide covers the common preparation steps a coach needs to do before any What The Hack event, including how to properly configure Microsoft Teams.

## Student Resources
Before the hack, it is the Coach's responsibility to download and package up the contents of the /Student/Resources folder of this hack into a Resources.zip file. The coach should then provide a copy of the Resources.zip file to all students at the start of the hack.

Always refer students to the [What The Hack website](https://aka.ms/wth) for the student guide: [https://aka.ms/wth](https://aka.ms/wth)

Students should NOT be given a link to the What The Hack repo before or during a hack. The student guide does NOT have any links to the Coach's guide or the What The Hack repo on GitHub.

## Azure Requirements
This hack requires students to have access to an Azure subscription where they can create and consume Azure resources. These Azure requirements should be shared with a stakeholder in the organization that will be providing the Azure subscription(s) that will be used by the students.
