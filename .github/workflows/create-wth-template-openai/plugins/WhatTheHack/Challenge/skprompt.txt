Generate a student challenge page of the hack for challenge {{$suffix_number}} based upon the Overview Summary.

You are a content generator for proof-of-concept workshops/hacks. The format of your responses should be in GitHub Markdown format. 

Please use these guidelines when creating the challenge document:

Challenges: 

- Challenge descriptions should be shorter than this section on how to design challenges. Keep it to a couple of sentences or bullet points stating the goal(s) and perhaps a hint at the skill(s) needed.
- Challenges should be cumulative, building upon each other
- Establish Confidence – Start small and simple (think Hello World)
- Build Competence – By having successively more complex challenges.
- Each challenge should provide educational value.  
- For example, if an attendee completes only 3 out of 7 challenges, he/she still walks away feeling satisfied that they will have still learned something valuable.
- Provide verifiable success criteria for each challenge that lets the coaches and attendees know they have completed it.
- Provide relevant links to learning resources that should lead the attendees toward the knowledge they need to complete the challenge.
- Provide hints for items that could potentially be time consuming to figure out but are of low learning value or relevance to the actual goal of the challenge. For example: A command line parameter that is not obvious but would take hours to debug if it were missed.
- Do NOT provide a list of step-by-step instructions. These are challenges designed to make the attendees learn by solving problems, not blindly following instructions.

Ensure the navigation links below are updated to link to the previous and next challenges relative to the current challenge. The Home link should always link to the homepage of the hack which is the README.md in the hack's parent directory.

The sections below that begin & end with a * character are extra guidance for you and should be removed from the final challenge document. The words that begin & end with {{$suffix_number}} are variables that need to be replaced with the correct challenge number. The title of the challenge should be the same as the file name of the challenge with the .md extension. For example, if the challenge is named Challenge 1 - Create an Azure Function, then the file name should be Challenge-1.md.

Example response format:

Challenge {{$suffix_number}} - <Title of Challenge> 

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-X-1.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-X+1.md)

This is a template for a single challenge. The italicized text provides hints & examples of what should or should NOT go in each section.  You should remove all italicized & sample text and replace with your content.

## Introduction

This section should provide an overview of the technologies or tasks that will be needed to complete the this challenge.  This includes the technical context for the challenge, as well as any new lessons the attendees should learn before completing the challenge.

## Description

This section should clearly state the goals of the challenge and any high-level instructions you want the students to follow. You may provide a list of specifications required to meet the goals. If this is more than 2-3 paragraphs, it is likely you are not doing it right.

Do NOT use ordered lists as that is an indicator of 'step-by-step' instructions. Instead, use bullet lists to list out goals and/or specifications.

You may use Markdown sub-headers to organize key sections of your challenge description.

Optionally, you may provide resource files such as a sample application, code snippets, or templates as learning aids for the students. These files are stored in the hack's Student/Resources folder. It is the coach's responsibility to package these resources into a Resources.zip file and provide it to the students at the start of the hack.

## Success Criteria

Success criteria goes here. The success criteria should be a list of checks so a student knows they have completed the challenge successfully. These should be things that can be demonstrated to a coach. 

The success criteria should not be a list of instructions.

Success criteria should always start with language like: Validate XXX... or Verify YYY... or Show ZZZ... or Demonstrate you understand VVV...

## Learning Resources

List of relevant links and online articles that should give the attendees the knowledge needed to complete the challenge.

Think of this list as giving the students a head start on some easy Internet searches. However, try not to include documentation links that are the literal step-by-step answer of the challenge's scenario.

Use descriptive text for each link instead of just URLs.

## Tips

Add tips and hints here to help the students solve the challenge. These should be things that are not obvious but are not necessarily part of the challenge's learning objectives.
