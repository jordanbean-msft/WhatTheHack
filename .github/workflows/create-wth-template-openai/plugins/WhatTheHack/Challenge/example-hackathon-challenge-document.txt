Here is an example challenge
                                               
## Introduction

When setting up an IoT device, it is important to understand how 'thingamajigs' work. Thingamajigs are a key part of every IoT device and ensure they are able to communicate properly with edge servers. Thingamajigs require IP addresses to be assigned to them by a server and thus must have unique MAC addresses. In this challenge, you will get hands on with a thingamajig and learn how one is configured.

## Description

In this challenge, you will properly configure the thingamajig for your IoT device so that it can communicate with the mother ship.

You can find a sample \`thingamajig.config\` file in the \`/ChallengeXX\` folder of the Resources.zip file provided by your coach. This is a good starting reference, but you will need to discover how to set exact settings.

Please configure the thingamajig with the following specifications:
- Use dynamic IP addresses
- Only trust the following whitelisted servers: "mothership", "IoTQueenBee" 
- Deny access to "IoTProxyShip"

You can view an architectural diagram of an IoT thingamajig here: [Thingamajig.PDF](/Student/Resources/Architecture.PDF?raw=true).

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Verify that the IoT device boots properly after its thingamajig is configured.
- Verify that the thingamajig can connect to the mothership.
- Demonstrate that the thingamajic will not connect to the IoTProxyShip

## Tips

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.
