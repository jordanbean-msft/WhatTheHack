# What The Hack - Logic Apps Enterprise Integration

## Introduction

This hack will help you understand how to use Logic Apps to integrate your enterprise systems with other systems and services.  You will learn how to use Logic Apps to connect to other Azure services.  You will also learn how to use Logic Apps to orchestrate complex workflows and business processes.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will learn how to:

- Expose a REST API endpoint for users to call
- Injest data from a JSON file into Azure Storage
- Write data to Azure SQL
- Modularize & add validation to your Logic App
- Integrate with Service Bus
- Monitor end-to-end workflows
- Authenticate with AzureAD when calling a custom API
- Author Logic Apps in Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Subscription](../../000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-subscription)
  - You will need _Owner_ permissions on the subscription to complete the hack (due to needing to grant RBAC access to the managed identity of the Logic App)
  - This hack can be run in a [Visual Studio subscription with Azure credits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/)
- [Managing Cloud Resources](../../000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#managing-cloud-resources)
  - [Azure Portal](../../000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-portal)
  - [Azure CLI](../../000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-cli)

  - [Azure Cloud Shell](../../000-HowToHack/WTH-Common-Prerequisites.md#azure-cloud-shell)
- [PowerShell Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3)
  - This is needed to run the Azure Developer CLI correctly. If you don't have PowerShell Core, you can use [Option 2](./Challenge-00.md#option-2-deploying-using-azure-cli) below.
