[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-07.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-09.md)

## Introduction

Editing the Logic App in the Azure portal is fine, but you also need to be able to check in your changes to source control.  This challenge will help you get started with Visual Studio Code. You can also do some editing directly in VS Code.

## Description

In this challenge, you will use Visual Studio Code to edit the Logic App that you created in the previous challenge.

- Download your app content from the Azure portal
- Copy the code into the `src/logic` directory of your repo
- Open the `workflow.json` files in both `code` & `Designer` view to compare them

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Verify that you can download the Logic App from the Azure portal
- Verify that you can open the Logic App in Visual Studio Code
